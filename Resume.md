When building a digital resume builder using Django, it's essential to structure your models in a way that allows flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Digital resumes can vary significantly in format, but they generally include certain sections and fields that you can organize into models.

Here's a breakdown of common sections and fields you should consider when designing the models for the resume feature:

   - **Location** (city, country)
   - **Profile Picture** (Optional)
   - **Summary/Objective** (Short description or professional summary)

### 2. **Work Experience**
   Work experience typically consists of job titles, companies, dates, and descriptions of the responsibilities and accomplishments.
   - **Job Title**
   - **Company Name**
   - **Location** (optional)
   - **Start Date** (Date field)
   - **End Date** (Date field or "Present" for ongoing positions)

   - **Proficiency Level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, or a numerical scale)
   - **Category** (optional, e.g., Technical Skills, Soft Skills)

### 5. **Certifications**
   This section includes any relevant certifications that the individual has earned.
   - **Certification Name**
   - **Issuing Organization**
   - **Issue Date**

   Languages spoken can be an important section, especially in international or multicultural environments.
   - **Language**
   - **Proficiency Level** (e.g., Fluent, Intermediate, Basic and other options)

### 10. **References**
   You may choose to include references on the resume, though some prefer to have “Available upon request.”
   - **Reference Name**
   - **Position**
   - **Organization**
   - **Email**
   - **Phone Number**

### 11. **Custom Sections**
   Depending on the user’s specific needs, you can allow for custom sections. For example, users may want to add sections for publications, conferences, patents, or personal statements.
   - **Section Name** (e.g., "Publications")
   - **Content** (e.g., "Published Research Paper")

---

### Key Considerations:

1. **Relationships:**
   - Use `ForeignKey` for relationships between the resume and other sections (Work Experience, Skills, etc.). This will allow users to have multiple entries in each section.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - If you want to allow for more flexible sections (e.g., "Custom Sections"), you can create a `Section` model that lets users define custom content and types.

### Example Django Models

Here’s a simplified example of how you could structure your models in `models.py` for a flexible digital resume builder:

```python
from django.db import models

class Resume(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Assuming each user has a resume
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    email = models.EmailField()
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    linkedin = models.URLField(blank=True)
    github = models.URLField(blank=True)
    website = models.URLField(blank=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    profile_picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='profile_pics/', blank=True)
    summary = models.TextField(blank=True)

class WorkExperience(models.Model):
    resume = models.ForeignKey(Resume, related_name='work_experiences', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    job_title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    company_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    description = models.TextField()
    achievements = models.TextField(blank=True)

class Education(models.Model):
    resume = models.ForeignKey(Resume, related_name='educations', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    degree = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    institution_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    major = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    relevant_coursework = models.TextField(blank=True)

class Skill(models.Model):
    resume = models.ForeignKey(Resume, related_name='skills', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    skill_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    proficiency = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)

class Certification(models.Model):
    resume = models.ForeignKey(Resume, related_name='certifications', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    certification_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    issuing_organization = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    issue_date = models.DateField()
    expiration_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    url = models.URLField(blank=True)

class Project(models.Model):
    resume = models.ForeignKey(Resume, related_name='projects', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    project_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField()
    tools_used = models.TextField(blank=True)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    project_url = models.URLField(blank=True)
    github_url = models.URLField(blank=True)
    project_role = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)

class Language(models.Model):
    resume = models.ForeignKey(Resume, related_name='languages', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    language = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    proficiency = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class Reference(models.Model):
    resume = models.ForeignKey(Resume, related_name='references', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    reference_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    position = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    organization = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    email = models.EmailField()
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=20)
```

### Key Considerations:

1. **Relationships:**
   - Use `ForeignKey` for relationships between the resume and other sections (Work Experience, Skills, etc.). This will allow users to have multiple entries in each section.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - If you want to allow for more flexible sections (e.g., "Custom Sections"), you can create a `Section` model that lets users define custom content and types.

3. **Additional Features:**
   - Allow users to export the resume in various formats (PDF, Word, etc.). You can use libraries like `WeasyPrint` or `ReportLab` to generate PDFs.
   - Consider adding templates or themes to give users the ability to choose different resume styles.

This structure provides a flexible way to build and extend your resume builder, while also making it adaptable to a variety of needs and resume styles.



Here is the required workflow. Users register and are taken to their dashboard. When they start the resume creaton process, they are teken through a multi-step information filling process where they input their details section by section. There should be fixed sections that the user would have to fill in and thise sections are important for any resume creation process. There should also be optional sections that the user user can choose to skip if they do not have details to input for those sections yet. There should also be able to save and continue from where they stopped later.
